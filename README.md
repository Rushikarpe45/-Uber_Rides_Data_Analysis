📌 Project Overview

This project is a data analysis case study on Uber rides. The goal is to understand travel patterns, ride categories, passenger behavior, and fare trends using real-world-like Uber dataset.
With the help of Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we explore and visualize the data to get useful insights that can help businesses like Uber improve services.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python 3
Pandas → For data cleaning & manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn → For visualization & charts
Jupyter Notebook → For running analysis interactively

📊 Key Analysis Done

Trips Analysis
Day vs Night rides comparison
Weekday vs Weekend ride frequency
Passenger Insights
Number of passengers per ride
Popular ride purposes (Work, Personal, Airport etc.)

Category Wise Analysis

UberX, UberBlack, UberXL, UberPool etc.

Which category is most used?
Distance & Fare
Relationship between distance and price
Long rides vs short rides patterns
Trends & Graphs
Time-based heatmaps
Top hours when people use Uber most
📷 Sample Visualizations
